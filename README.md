 If-else keyword built into nearly every programming language and simple conditional logic are easy for anyone to understand. If you are a programmer, you know else keyword.<a href="https://educationalstd.com">Education</a> is important But if you are a good programmer, don’t use this keyword. One of the biggest mistakes I fell into when starting was overusing the else keyword when writing conditionals. I stopped using this keyword in my programs since 5 years ago. Let me explain!
Why

Think about what else means, it means “if A then this, if not A then that;”. This isn’t a problem if A is binary — the problem space is only 2 cases. But if A is a combination of binary variables, or contains larger variables, your negative problem space can be unexpectedly large and difficult to understand, test and maintain. To avoid if/else if, to only use if statements, to spend the time to ensure the entry criteria for your group of if’s are mutually exclusive so that the answers don’t depend on the order of execution.

    It promotes the main execution lane, with a few special cases.
    It forces us to write all conditions, required to process the data, at the beginning of each function.
    Use a switch — case statement.
    Use polymorphism to handle complex conditional cases, making the code more clear like State Pattern.

Example

Our example is a traffic light (i.e. TrafficLight object) with 3 different states: Red, Yellow and Green, each with its own set of rules. The rules go like this:

    Say the traffic light is Red. After a delay the Red state changes to the Green state.
    Then, after another delay <a href="https://ceptelefonu.adanasektorel.com/adana-huawei-teknik-servisi">adana huawei servisi</a>
    
 , the Green state changes to the Yellow state.
    After a very brief delay the Yellow state is changed to Red.
    And on and on.
    
I have a simple philosophy in life I’ve learned from people much smarter than me. That is, watch the people you don’t want to be like, and do the opposite of what they do.

I’m not trying to be a dick, but I have more than enough examples to last a million lifetimes. Let’s call a spade a spade. Masses of men and women are highly ineffective. I think they’re good people with good hearts, but I don’t want to be like them at all. Being like them was always one of my biggest fears.

And I was like them at one point. I’m no saint. I’ve screwed up more in my life than I’ve been productive. Fortunately, you don’t need to be productive for a super long time to succeed and once you start being effective, the past tends to fade away no matter how long you spent being ineffective.

So the good news? You can change.

The bad news? The odds are stacked against you.

The best route? Instead of trying to figure out what to do, focus on what not to do, starting with these habits that practically guarantee you’ll fall short of your own expectations.
Focus On This Fake Clown Show B.S. Circus

    “To be completely cured of newspapers, spend a year reading the previous week’s newspapers.” — Nassim Taleb.

Anyone who says they “want to stay informed” is an ineffective person — and they’re also ill-informed because the news is a massive psyop designed to misinform.

If you had a ton of positive things going on in your life — career, business, health, networking, etc — you wouldn’t have time to be obsessed with the news.

I don’t even avoid the news on purpose anymore. It’s so far down the list of my priorities that it might as well not exist.

The effectiveness equation makes no <a href="https://elegancemobilya.com/cat/yatak-odasi-takimlari">Yatak Odasi Takimlari</a><br> sense. Where is your focus more effective? Focusing on changing yourself as an individual? Or trying to change the world?

Not only is it not useful to be obsessed with the news and mainstream media, but it’s also counterproductive and sucks your energy. War, rape, kids dying, shootings, stabbings, political fighting.

How could you be in an effective ‘go-getter’ mood if you spent a bunch of time focused on subjects like these?

Almost 100% of the people I’ve observed who are obsessed with the news in politics have the following traits:

    They look unhealthy and worn down
    Irritable
    Never have a lingerie(<a href="http://ahusarar.com">fantezi ic giyim</a>) in their life that provides meaning

The important stuff will get to you. Trust me.

Focus on yourself.
Focus On the Wrong Parts of Projects

    “Let go of the thing that you’re trying to be (the noun), and focus on the actual work you need to be doing (the verb).” — Austin Kleon

There are two ways to go about projects like writing, shooting YouTube videos, starting a business, whatever it may be.

    Person A focuses on window dressing. They need to have their blog perfectly set up and designed before they start writing. They need an expensive camera and lighting set up to start their YouTube channel. Instead of looking for customers for their business, they buy business cards, set up their LLC even though they’re making no money, and add “CEO” to their Twitter bio.
    Person B gets cheap hosting for their blog, has it set up in hours, and starts writing. When I started my YouTube channel, I just opened my laptop and started shooting videos on my normal <a href="https://elegancemobilya.com/cat/oturma-gruplari">Oturma Gruplari</a></p>. If you want to start a business right now, say freelancing, you could instantly jump on LinkedIn and start pitching people.

Person B always wins.

Entire businesses have been built on scouring LinkedIn, setting up simple landing pages, blogs, and online stores. No need for the fancy window dressing to be successful.

I notice often that people who are beginners at <a href="https://adana-evden-eve-nakliyat-2.kiraliksite.com>adana evden eve nakliyat</a>
something but have good production and packaging almost always fail. Perfectionists get the least traction. Those who dive in and ‘just do’ tend to win.</div>
